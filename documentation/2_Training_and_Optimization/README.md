# ⚙️ 2. Training and Optimization

This section provides a complete and detailed reference for every argument that controls the training process, as defined in `train_args.py`.

## Table of Contents

-   [**Core Training**](./1_Core_Training.md): Arguments that define the fundamental parameters of the training run, such as the dataset, batch size, and number of iterations.
-   [**Initialization & Checkpointing**](./2_Initialization_and_Checkpointing.md): Configuration for how training is started (from scratch, resumed, or fine-tuned) and how checkpoints are saved.
-   [**Optimizer**](./3_Optimizer.md): A deep dive into all available optimizers and their specific hyperparameters.
-   [**Learning Rate Scheduler**](./4_Learning_Rate_Scheduler.md): A complete guide to the different learning rate schedulers and their configurations.
-   [**Multi-Dataset Training**](./5_Multi-Dataset_Training.md): Documentation for the advanced multi-dataset and multi-context training modes.
-   [**System & Hardware**](./6_System_and_Hardware.md): Arguments that control the system-level configuration, such as the device, data type, and model compilation.
