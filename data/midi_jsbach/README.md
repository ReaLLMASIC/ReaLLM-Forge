# JS Bach Midi Dataset

Scripts for processing [czhuang's JSB-Chorales-dataset](https://github.com/czhuang/JSB-Chorales-dataset/tree/master),
this collection adopts the train, validation, and test division as outlined by
Boulanger-Lewandowski in 2012.

This dataset has 382 chorales by Johann Sebastian Bach, whose music in is the
public domain, at 1/16th note resolution.

Each chord is represented by four integers, signifying the note's position on a
piano keyboard; a value of '-1' indicates that no note is being played.
