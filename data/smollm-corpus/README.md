# SmolLM-Corpus

This directory contains scripts compatible with the SmolLM-Corpus dataset.

## Description

ðŸ“š SmolLM-Corpus is a curated collection of high-quality educational and synthetic data designed for training small language models. It consists of three main subsets: Cosmopedia v2, Python-Edu, and FineWeb-Edu (deduplicated). More details about the models trained on this dataset can be found in the SmolLM blog post.

## Dataset Subsets

### Cosmopedia v2

Cosmopedia v2 is an enhanced version of Cosmopedia, consisting of over 39 million textbooks, blog posts, and stories generated by Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1. Most samples are generated by prompting the model to create content on specific topics using a web page as a "seed sample".

### Python-Edu

The Python-Edu subset consists of Python files extracted from the stack-v2-train dataset, scored 4 or more by an educational code model.

### FineWeb-Edu (deduplicated)

FineWeb-Edu-Dedup is a deduplicated subset of the FineWeb-Edu dataset, containing 220 billion tokens of educational web pages. It was filtered using an educational quality classifier to retain only the highest quality educational content.

## Dataset Curation

The curation process varies for each subset:

- Cosmopedia v2: Generated using Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 with web samples as seeds to increase diversity.
- Python-Edu: Extracted from stack-v2-train and scored by an educational code model.
- FineWeb-Edu: Filtered using an educational quality classifier from the original FineWeb dataset.

## Loading the Dataset

```sh
bash get_dataset.sh
```
Resulting input.txt files for processing will be in each sub-dataset's respective folder.

## License

The dataset usage is subject to the terms and conditions of each subset. Please refer to the original sources for specific licensing information.
