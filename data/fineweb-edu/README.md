This directory contains scripts compatible with the Fineweb-Edu dataset.

## Description

üìö FineWeb-Edu dataset consists of 1.3T tokens and 5.4T tokens
(FineWeb-Edu-score-2) of educational web pages filtered from üç∑ FineWeb dataset.
The work includes an educational quality classifier using annotations generated
by LLama3-70B-Instruct to retain the most educational web pages. FineWeb-Edu
outperforms FineWeb on popular benchmarks and shows the power of classifiers
trained on synthetic data.

## Dataset Curation

FineWeb-Edu uses Llama3-70B-Instruct to score 500k FineWeb samples for
educational quality on a scale from 0 to 5.

A threshold of 3 during the filtering process, retaining a high-level
educational pages. A fine-tuned Bert-like regression model was createdd using
these annotations, achieving an F1 score of 82%. Filtering out samples with
scores lower than 3 removed 92% of the dataset, leaving 1.3T educational tokens.
