## Fineweb-Edu

üìö FineWeb-Edu dataset consists of 1.3T tokens and 5.4T tokens (FineWeb-Edu-score-2) of educational web pages filtered from üç∑ FineWeb dataset. We developed an educational quality classifier using annotations generated by LLama3-70B-Instruct to retain the most educational web pages. FineWeb-Edu outperforms FineWeb on popular benchmarks and shows the power of classifiers trained on synthetic data.

## Dataset Curation

We used Llama3-70B-Instruct to score 500k FineWeb samples for their educational quality on a scale from 0 to 5. By setting a threshold of 3 during the filtering process, we retained high-level educational pages. We fine-tuned a Bert-like regression model using these annotations, achieving an F1 score of 82%. Filtering out samples with scores lower than 3 removed 92% of the dataset, leaving 1.3T educational tokens.
